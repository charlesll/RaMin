## Automatic recognition of Raman spectra of minerals

Participants: Alexis Falcin, Lucile Chauveau, Matthias Meschede, Emilie Pirot, Charles Le Losq

[Raman spectra]() are unique signatures of the structure of minerals and glasses. We thus can use them to recognize minerals and glasses, and quantify their proportions in a sample as well as the presence of specific elements in them.

The present project has the aim of testing various methods to automatically recognize minerals and quantify their proportions in Raman spectra.

Data are from the RRUFF database and are available [there](http://rruff.info/), all the code uses free open source libraries in Python.
